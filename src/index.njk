      <h2>About Laputa SF</h2>
      <p>
        Many people want to be able to spend time with their friends more often, 
        but also aren't quite willing to live in a full
        group house. Laputa SF is intended as a
        <a href="https://fractalnyc.com/">Fractal NYC</a>
        inspired community of friends who all live in 100 Van Ness.

        We're still in the process of forming and figuring out 
        what exactly the shape of things will be. However, some things we
        expect to host include potlucks, shared meals, movie nights, 
        and silly software projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        We're inspired by essays like <a href="https://prigoose.substack.com/p/how-to-live-near-your-friends">How to Live Near Your Friends</a>.

      <p>
        We also exist in contrast with the large grouphouse scene in San Francisco.
        Grouphouses aren't necesarilly a good fit for every lifestyle. They are often challenging 
        for couples or those with children.
        Additionally, if you are the kind of person who enjoys cooking and having
        a well-stocked kitchen, many (though not all) grouphouses can be challenging.
        We think that we can help people find the community and support of living
        near friends, but with the privacy and flexibility that personal dwellings afford.

        This does come with downsides, particularly cost and coordination. We aim
        to provide a schelling point for people interested in this lifestyle, alongside
        guidance that makes moving in and meeting your neighbors as easy as possible.
        For those who would like to have roommates, we also will help match you with
        current residents who are looking for someone to share their home with.

        This website is intended to serve as a living manifesto for the project, as well
        as a home for various resources for potential and current members of the community.
