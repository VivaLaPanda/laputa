      <h2>About Laputa SF</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">A new vision for urban living at 100 Van Ness</p>
      <p>Laputa SF is a mature, community-focused living experiment that reimagines what shared urban spaces can be. We are thoughtfully curated for couples, families, and professionals looking for a refined shared living experience.</p>
      <p>Unlike typical group houses that cater to a more casual lifestyle, we focus on elegant living — think sophisticated dinner parties rather than just pizza nights — while fostering a sense of independence and community.</p>
