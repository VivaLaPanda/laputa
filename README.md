# Laputa SF

A community living experiment at 100 Van Ness, inspired by Castle in the Sky and taking cues from the successful Fractal NYC model.

## Vision
Laputa SF is a distributed community living project, bringing together people who want to live near friends while maintaining their independence. Unlike traditional group houses, we focus on couples, families, and individuals seeking a more mature shared living experience.

## Aesthetic & Voice
Drawing inspiration from Studio Ghibli's "Castle in the Sky", our aesthetic balances whimsy with sophisticated urban living:
- Clean, airy design with architectural illustration elements
- Sophisticated but playful copy
- Core tagline: "Your castle in the sky awaits"
- Focus on the balance of independence and community

## Key Content Sections
- Hero: Full-viewport architectural illustration with tagline
- About: Explaining our vision of community living
- Getting Involved: Resources and next steps for potential members
- Projects: (Placeholder for future community initiatives)

## Technical Implementation
Building with 11ty static site generator:
- Minimal, close to vanilla HTML/CSS
- Build-time templating
- Serving static files via Nginx
- Using Nunjucks for templates
